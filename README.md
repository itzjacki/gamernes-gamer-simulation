This repository contains a crude simulation I have created in order to prepare in the most efficient way for a gaming tournament between me and my friends (see https://github.com/itzjacki/gamernesgamer.no). It is created quickly, with code that's hard to reuse. If I end up using this for future seasons I will probably make the code a bit easier to reuse, but no promises.

If any of the other participants of the tournament stumble onto this repository, please don't look inside - that will make me have to make this private which means I can't show it to my other friends. That would suck.
